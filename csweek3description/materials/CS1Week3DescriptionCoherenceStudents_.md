##  Element 1. Description
  
##  1. Description
  
>  In the description phase, you say what you are going to reflect on and what actually happened. You can address questions such as **what, where, when etc.** that are related to describing.
#####  Helpful questions:
  
- When and where did it happen?
- What happened?
- Why were you there?
- Who was present?
- What did you and the other people do?
- What was the outcome of the situation?
- What did you hope or want to happen?
  
###  Example description
  
##  Activity 1
  
> Go to Activity 1 in [Week 3 worksheet.](CS1Week3worksheetStudents.md##activity1 )
  
1. Does the paragraph effectively and fully describe the writer’s first day at work? 
2. Is the paragraph clear, readable and logically structured? How/Why?
3. Identify the techniques the writer has used to make the paragraph coherent **(means linked together, readable and easy to follow)**? Find examples of each of these techniques.
4. Would you expect to see the writer express their feelings and thoughts, evaluate and analyse in this paragraph? Why/not?
5. If you were asked to write this paragraph again, how could you do it better?
  
  
##  Coherence and cohesion
  
> ### This is the second of the four marking criteria to be used to assess your work. 
> ### Read the following explanation, use the internet if necessary and then share your understanding of the terms Coherence and Cohesion with your friends.
  
- Academic writing demands that your texts are both cohesive and coherent.
- Cohesive writing is writing that ‘sticks together’; 
- the language flows easily and smoothly
- from one phrase to the next,
- from one sentence to the next,
- from one paragraph to the next. 
- Coherent writing is also writing that ‘sticks together’; 
- but here it is ideas that flow logically,
- so your text can be easily interpreted by the reader,
- so that it doesn’t require the reader 
- to guess how you reached your conclusion.
  
###   Why not cohesive/coherent?
