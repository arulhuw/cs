# 7 A reflective diary or learning journal





## 1  Introduction

- Students across a range of disciplines are often asked to keep a reflective diary,
  portfolio or journal. 
- This is not really surprising since a diary/log/journal is a record of
your development as a learner or practitioner in your field. 
- Exactly what goes in your
journal will, of course, vary from one discipline to another.


### Learning journals in creative and technical subjects
- Students learning to create or build something – for example 
  - a bridge (Engineering),
  - a  product (Product Design),
  - a structure (Architecture) or
  - an artwork (Creative Arts) 

-  will be learning to:
    - **look at** or observe objects, paintings, structures
    - **analyse** what they see (form, function, materials)
    - **consider** how each element contributes to the whole
    - **be aware** of how they have borrowed, changed or built on the ideas of other practitioners, artists or theories
    - **reflect** on their own developmental process: starting, experimenting, changing,adapting, starting again.

## 2 Description
- This development of ideas is likely to be recorded in a personal **record** or**sketchbook** or lab diary. 
- Often it is only later that you can see the origins of the ideas you work on. You don’t see it at the time, 
- which, of course, under- lines the **importance of these informal records**, 
  - not only for students in these disciplines but for everyone who wants or needs to chart their development. 
    - Only at the end of the process do you see the path to the outcome clearly.
- You can then write a summative piece that explains and justifies the choices you made along the way:


### Example
- The starting point for this work came from a trip to **Africa**.
  - **Brief context**
- **I noticed** a variety of objects washed up on the beach, old jeans, shoes and sacks and I tried to imagine who they might have belonged to ...
  - **Imagining and reflecting**
  - **Observing and reflecting**

## 3 Thoughts/Feelings
- I looked at Marcel Duchamp, Christian Boltanski and Bill Woodrow to see how artists made use of found **objects**
  - **Building on other artists’work**
- I **noticed** that when two or three unrelated objects were placed together [...] the audience would find themselves trying to identify a link between the objects 
  - **Observing and reflecting**
  - **Awareness of audience and reflecting**
- I looked at ways of preserving the objects and learnt about casting and the range of materials to cast from including **wax**, chocolate, resin and plaster 
### **Experimenting**
- I wasn’t really happy with how the wax teacup **turned out** I became fascinated with **shoes** 
  - **Testing feelings and reflecting**
  - **changing**
- I discovered **fibreglass** – the delicacy and opaqueness of the fiberglass shoes 
  - **Experimenting reflecting**
- I hope the installation stimulates the memories
and imagination of the **audience**. 
  - **Connecting with audience**

## 4 Evaluation/Analysis										


## Design, construct, test ... to destruction
- Technical courses at college or university
  - Engineering 
  - Computing
  - Architecture – 
- **add a bit of spice**to the process outlined above. 
- At some point in the course,  students are likely to
- work in design teams:
  - Does better teamwork lead to better designs?
 - sketch or model the design: 
   - How does it help the design process?
- build it within the constraints of materials, cost and time
- test it to destruction: How resilient is the structure? How well designed?
- Finally, looking back and reflecting on the whole process, what have you learnt?

## 5 Time to reflect on ...



- Keep it simple stupid (KISS) one person talked 
  - **like**
    - **Group processes**
-  he knew what he was  doing  but it was far too 
   -  **complicated** 
      -  **Design process**
-  to build in time and our semi-finished 
-  bridge didn’t even support 
-  itself.

We should have organised the construction better. We rushed and half the team didn’t know what to do. The team next door even had cutting lists and everybody had jobs – they didn’t rush and finished early.

- Group processes
- Design process
- Construction and
- destruction

## 6  Reflection-2
### more students’ reflections show the range of their learning:

- We should have drawn it to scale with load in position.
- We wasted materials when we realised we'd cut it too short.
- The group hadn’t realised that unless the towers are tied back at each end they add nothing. 
- Often the bridges with the most material were the weakest! They hadn’t thought about ...

- You could see why it was helpful to sketch to scale ... it made it look real.
- Others in our ‘team’ just chatted and larked about.
- Once the load began tipping sideways you could see it had become unstable.



## 7  And finally ...
>##### Take another look at the comments above. Decide which aspect or combination of

- aspects of the process each one illustrates:

|Group processes |Design process |Construction/destruction|
|----------------|---------------|------------------------|

> You’ll see how much learning about bridge construction comes from reflection throughout the assignment.Learning journals in professional courses

> Learning journals help to develop your practice as a professional by:
- recording your own practice and actions
- noticing what went well and what needs development
- acknowledging issues, problems and areas that need attention
- planning for future actions to help with areas of challenge.

## Learning journals in education


- I found the behaviour of the class really 
  - challenging.(**Record your actions and notice what has not gone well.)**
- I realise I was not differentiating between kinds
- of >>
  - **difficult (Notice what needs development)**  behaviour: for example, one child is
- frustrated because she is gifted and the class is too
- slow; one child has attachment issues and can’t
- settle among other children; one I know has been
- bullied and daren’t speak up. I just got frustrated
- that it wasn’t working and didn’t 
  - **even(Acknowledge areas that need attention)** think about
- strategies that would work for those different needs.
- I definitely need to research these issues and what
- best practice is for each of 
  - them. **(Plan for future actions)**

## Learning journals in Health and Social Care
> A Health/Social Care student will learn to:
- participate in or observe an incident (such as the care of a client)
- discuss what went well and not so well about it

- analyse their thoughts about it, by linking to relevant theory/policy/science/guidance, and to the experience of others
- reflect on how this links to their own experiences – how could this inform their future practice?
- A junior nurse’s reflective diary entry

- Last week my mentor transferred a client into 
  - her -----------------------
    - Describing the incident
- bed without using any equipment to assist her. 
- The client was unable to 
  - stand safely. 
    - Observing
- However my mentor said there was no hoist nearby and it would take too much time to go and find 
  - one The incident continued. Unstated concern about poor practice
   

- Since then I have had my moving and handling training update. 
- Under the Manual Handling Operations Regulations (Health and Safety Executive 2004), all staff have a duty to attend moving and handling training, and to make full 
  - use 
    - The incident continued. Unstated concern about poor practice
- 
- of any equipment available to them in their place of work to assist them in moving and
handling patients or objects. 
  - I am 
    - sure Reflection on practices and implications
- that using a hoist would have reduced the risk of injury to the patient as well as to the nurse who was moving her.


- After my training, I feel more 
- confident 
  - Reflection on self and future practice

- to challenge others’ practice, and I realise the importance of being assertive to ensure my own safety as well as the safety of clients and colleagues.
- Reflection on self and future practice

## A medical student reflects


- [The exercise] was to consider the approaches a doctor might take with a 
  - **person** 
    - **Incident/activity**
- with a chronic- illness. To be honest, I 
  - **didn’t** 
    - **Feelings/reflections**
- want to do this, as some things were too close to the bone. I’m glad I
- did though as the scenario our group was given was one I had never particularly 
  - **considered**, 
    - **New learning**
- and I was able to consider what [the person’s] particular needs would be. I suppose it was a case of separating personal and 
  - **professional**
    -  **New learning in professional context – generalising to make the link between this experience and prior understanding of the issue (personal and professional attitudes)**
-  attitudes ...
