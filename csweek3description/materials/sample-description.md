## when/where did it happen
I am currently on a teaching practice placement in an adult education college in the south-west of England, learning how to teach GCSE maths to various groups of adults. As my placement is in the early stages, I am mainly assisting the class lecturers and have just started planning and delivering a small part of each lesson.

## what happened 
The incident I am reflecting on in this paper occurred in an evening class in which I was due to deliver my very first teaching session. The class lecturer had been teaching the learners about fractions, one of the commonly used mathematical topics, and 

## why were you there
my task was to continue with the same topic, looking specifically at how to multiply two 
fractions. 

## what happened 
However, when I was due to teach the session and got to the whiteboard, I became so nervous that I struggled to speak to the group. I felt myself visibly shaking and was unable to articulate even my first sentence coherently. 

## who was present
The students 

## What did you/ other people do
were quite understanding, as they were all mature people who were aware that I was new to teaching and that I was nervous, but the teacher was unsympathetic and responded by taking over the lesson instantly. She did not even say a thing to me but started teaching the class as if nothing had happened there. 

## Hope- not mentioned, but implied (the class teacher should not have intervened)
Very perplexed and upset, I went to the
back of the classroom and sat at one of the desks trying not to cry. I left the session as soon as the class was over and did not speak to anyone there that day.
