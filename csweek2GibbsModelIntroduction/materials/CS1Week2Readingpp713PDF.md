> For students who have never experienced reflective practice, it is hard to see the experience in a personal and analytical way.(Lecturer, Product Design)

Reflective writing is new to most people.  The comments below point to the confusion around reflective writing when it is part of a course and is assessed in some way:
- ‘I thought I wasn’t supposed to use “I” in my writing.’
- ‘I’m not putting what I really think if it’s going to be assessed!’
-  ‘They say to reflect on the link between theory and practice – but what does that mean?’
- ‘Can I say what I think without backing it up with references?’
>You can see the opposite pulls when reflective writing is a required part of a programme. Tutors are aware of it too, and try to resolve it in a number of ways.

- For example, tutors may:
  - want to know that an informal private log or diary exists, that you add to it regularly, but they do not directly assess the contents
  - ask you to respond to specific questions that draw
on your ‘private’ record or recollections
  - ask you to select incidents or experiences from
your private records, and to write about them to
show how they have contributed to your learning.

> ##### On further reflection, this experience highlights a series of faults with my actions … I should have used my initiative and checked. (Ben p55 )
*Your writing is personal, but not private*

## ‘Reflection’ means different things in different disciplines
-  In all subjects you need to think reflectively about what you learn.
-  Part of your training as a student is to familiarise you with the specific ways of thinking in your discipline: 

- The common thread that runs through all these is the whirring sound of thinking:
-  stepping back to think and reflect is a conscious and deliberate process. 
-  Reflection is the route to making sense of it all.

## Definition of reflective practice(reflection)

 >#####  … trying to make a connection between what was up on the board or in the notes, and something that I actually experienced in real life (p59).1
(Electronic Engineering student)


>#####  A good healthy dose of cynicism – keep your mind open in case new data comes in (p60). 
(Biological Sciences lecturer)


>##### … weigh different situations and find a middle road … you’re having to account  for things that the theory  hasn’t accounted for (p62).
(Economics lecturer)

>##### The first fundamental thing to grasp is that all is not what it seems to be (p63). (Media and
Communications student)


>##### We expect students to develop personal skills of analysis independent of other critical authorities.
(English Literature lecturer)

>##### Reflection isn’t navel-gazing. It’s about moving on to an outcome. 
(Hospitality lecturer)

>##### We show how our ideas develop – why we did it, what we meant by it, who influenced us, how we changed things.
(Creative Arts student)

>##### It’s a way of helping us to make sense of our experiences, linking to theory and research, to help us develop our practice … 
(Health and Social Care student)


>##### We have to say what we have learnt about our own practice as a teacher do to improve the way we teach. 
(Education student)


>##### You’ve got to know yourself. You can’t apply for a job unless you do. 
(Careers adviser)



## Reflective writing tasks are different too
- You may also be required to demonstrate reflection
in specific writing tasks, or in a ‘reflective’ style of
writing.
- These too will differ from subject to subject –
both in the content (what you write about) and in the process (how you write). 
- The first step is to look at what you have been asked to do.

## The task:  how is it described?
- Tutors set tasks that are tailored to the needs and practices of the particular discipline you are studying.
  - They are described in a variety of ways:
    - Diary 
    - Journal 
    - Learning log 
    - Reading log 
    - Lesson evaluation
    - E-portfolio 
    - Reading portfolio
    - Log book 
    - Blog 
    - Action learning
    - Artist’s notebook 
    - Research log 
    - Field log 
    - Podcast
    - Design report 
    - Annotated bibliography
    - Lab notebook
    - Simulation 
    - Critical incident report
    - Work placement diary
    - Discussion forum Observation
    - Self-assessment
    - Reflective statement
    - Practice portfolio 
    - Reflective essay 


>  The emphasis will differ from one course to another, but in all these forms of writing you are likely to include an element of reflection on:
- yourself
- how you learn
- how you learn from what you have done, thought, experienced and created
- how your knowledge and understanding have developed through your reading
- how you link theory and practice
- how your learning shapes further learning, your practice, work placement or employment.
>In short, your writing will be about how you, your understanding and your skills develop and change over time.


## What guidance have you been given?
> You will often be given headings or questions to guide you as to what you are expected to write about and how you should structure your work.

### For example  Diary: six diary entries

>##### The online diary will be based on a series of questions and discussion points introduced in class and developed through reflection, assignments and discussion with class peers.

### Each entry should be about 250 words.

### Diary entry 1
- Are there any patterns in the way I work as a learner in classes at school/college/university?
- What approaches and methods work best for me?
- What approaches and methods work least well?
- How might this understanding help me as a teacher?
- This gives you clear advice on the content and structure. Now look further through your course materials to see **how the task is assessed**. For the task above this includes:
> ### Demonstrating awareness of the connections between your own learning experiences and the practice and principles of good teaching.

- This gives you some really useful guidance. 
- The task is an invitation to reflect on how you learn. 
- It isn’t enough just to describe or ‘tell the story’ of your learning. 
- You must also show that you can pick out what you have learnt from the classes and your reading, 
- and that you are reflecting on how you might apply this learning to your eventual practice. 
  
  ### For example

|Don’t tell the story!|                     Select and apply|
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|
|I set up a listening activity with the      |  The listening activity, a news clip about
|children. They listened to a news clip      |  polar bears, really interested the children
|and numbered four pictures in the right     |  but I was so focused on the exercise I
|order. The activity finished in 5 minutes   |  didn’t give them a chance to talk about it
|although I planned it for 10 minutes.       |  and finished too quickly.
