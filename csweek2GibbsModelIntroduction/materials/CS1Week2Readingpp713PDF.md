# Getting started on reflective writing
> For students who have never experienced reflective practice, it is hard to see the experience in a personal and analytical way.(Lecturer, Product Design)

Reflective writing is new to most people.  The comments below point to the confusion around reflective writing when it is part of a course and is assessed in some way:
- ‘I thought I wasn’t supposed to use “I” in my writing.’
- ‘I’m not putting what I really think if it’s going to be assessed!’
-  ‘They say to reflect on the link between theory and practice – but what does that mean?’
- ‘Can I say what I think without backing it up with references?’
>You can see the opposite pulls when reflective writing is a required part of a programme. Tutors are aware of it too, and try to resolve it in a number of ways.

- For example, tutors may:
  - want to know that an informal private log or diary exists, that you add to it regularly, but they do not directly assess the contents
  - ask you to respond to specific questions that draw
on your ‘private’ record or recollections
  - ask you to select incidents or experiences from
your private records, and to write about them to
show how they have contributed to your learning.

> ##### On further reflection, this experience highlights a series of faults with my actions … I should have used my initiative and checked. (Ben p55 )
*Your writing is personal, but not private*

## ‘Reflection’ means different things in different disciplines
-  In all subjects you need to think reflectively about what you learn.
-  Part of your training as a student is to familiarise you with the specific ways of thinking in your discipline: 

- The common thread that runs through all these is the whirring sound of thinking:
-  stepping back to think and reflect is a conscious and deliberate process. 
-  Reflection is the route to making sense of it all.

## Reflective writing tasks are different too
- You may also be required to demonstrate reflection
in specific writing tasks, or in a ‘reflective’ style of
writing.
- These too will differ from subject to subject –
both in the content (what you write about) and in the process (how you write). 
- The first step is to look at what you have been asked to do.

## The task:  how is it described?
- Tutors set tasks that are tailored to the needs and practices of the particular discipline you are studying. They are described in a variety of ways:

- Diary 
- Journal 
- Learning log 
- Reading log 
- Lesson evaluation
- E-portfolio 
- Reading portfolio
- Log book 
- Blog 
- Action learning
- Artist’s notebook 
- Research log 
- Field log 
- Podcast
- Design report 
- Annotated bibliography
- Lab notebook
- Simulation 
- Critical incident report
- Work placement diary
- Discussion forum Observation
- Self-assessment
- Reflective statement
- Practice portfolio 
- Reflective essay 


>### The emphasis will differ from one course to another, but in all these forms of writing you are likely to include an element of reflection on:
- yourself
- how you learn
- how you learn from what you have done, thought, experienced and created
- how your knowledge and understanding have developed through your reading
- how you link theory and practice
- how your learning shapes further learning, your practice, work placement or employment.

>### In short, your writing will be about how you, your understanding and your skills develop and change over time.


## What guidance have you been given?
> You will often be given headings or questions to guide you as to what you are expected to write about and how you should structure your work.

### For example  Diary: six diary entries

>### The online diary will be based on a series of questions and discussion points introduced in class and developed through reflection, assignments and discussion with class peers.

### Each entry should be about 250 words.

### Diary entry 1
- Are there any patterns in the way I work as a learner in classes at school/
college/university?
- What approaches and methods work best for me?
- What approaches and methods work least well?
- How might this understanding help me as a teacher?
- This gives you clear advice on the content and structure. Now look further through your course materials to see **how the task is assessed**. For the task above this includes:
> ### Demonstrating awareness of the connections between your own learning experiences and the practice and principles of good teaching.

- This gives you some really useful guidance. 
- The task is an invitation to reflect on how you learn. 
- It isn’t enough just to describe or ‘tell the story’ of your learning. 
- You must also show that you can pick out what you have learnt from the classes and your reading, 
- and that you are reflecting on how you might apply this learning to your eventual practice. 
  
  ### For example

|Don’t tell the story!|                     Select and apply|
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|
|I set up a listening activity with the      |  The listening activity, a news clip about
|children. They listened to a news clip      |  polar bears, really interested the children
|and numbered four pictures in the right     |  but I was so focused on the exercise I
|order. The activity finished in 5 minutes   |  didn’t give them a chance to talk about it
|although I planned it for 10 minutes.       |  and finished too quickly.
