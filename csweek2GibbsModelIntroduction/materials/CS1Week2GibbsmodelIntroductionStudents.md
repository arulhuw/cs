## Definitions of reflection
> Open the document Week 2 worksheetials/CS1 Week3 Kortextreading.pdf and do Activity 1.
- [worksheets](/csweek3/materials/CS1Week3worksheetStudents.docx)
- [worksheets notes](/csweek2GibbsModelIntroduction/materials/CS1Week2worksheetStudents.md)
- Look at the definitions of reflection 
  - taken [from page 9 of your reading book](/csweek2GibbsModelIntroduction/materials/CS1Week2Readingpp713PDF.pdf)
    - notes [from reading ](/csweek2GibbsModelIntroduction/materials/CS1Week2worksheetStudents.md#activity-1-–-definitions-of-reflective-practice-or-reflection) 

1. Do the different definitions mean the same? 
2. Can reflection mean different things in different subjects?  Why?
3. Which definition would you prefer to use, generally? Why? 
4. For your assignment (Reflective Writing) purposes, would you use one of these definitions? Or would you come up with a new one combining relevant elements in them?

## Gibbs’ reflective model

- **Action plan** if it arose again what will you do?
- **Description** What happened?
- **Feelings** What were you thinking and feeling ?
- **Evaluation** What was good and bad about the experience ?
- **Analysis** What sense can you make of the situation ?
- **Conclusion** What else could you have done

## Analysing the reflective model

> ### Look at the reflective model by Gibbs (1988) and do [Activity 2 in the worksheet](/csweek2GibbsModelIntroduction/materials/CS1Week2worksheetStudents.md#activity-2--gibbs-reflective-model)

1. How many elements are there in this model? Which is the starting point in the model?
2. What is involved in each element?
3. Why is each element important in this reflective cycle?
4. Have you seen any other reflective models? How are they different from this one?
5. As you see, this model was introduced in 1988? Do you think it is still relevant and applicable? Why?

## Introductory section

### Introduction - Activity    


1. Why is an introductory section important in a piece of writing? How does it help the readers?
2. What do you think should go in an introduction? What is the purpose of each sentence/part in an introduction?
3. What % of the whole work should an introduction be? 50%?
4. What is a thesis statement? Why / How does it help the readers? Where do you usually write a thesis statement in a piece of writing?
5. Does an introduction need an outline? Why (not)?

## Introductory paragraph

> ### So, let us sum up that:
> ### an introductory paragraph contains:
1. Opening sentence
2. Background details
3. Thesis statement
4. Outline

## Opening sentence

>### The first sentence of the introductory paragraph introduces the topic/theme to the readers. It helps readers know what the topic is.

**For example**
-   Topic: Reflective writing on how you used technology in your lessons/lectures
-   Opening/introducing the topic: Technology plays a very big role in the life of a successful student.

- Can you come up with an opening sentence for this topic?
  - Reflective writing on your greatest achievement last year
>**Ans: Achievements help us value ourselves and what we do.**

## Background details

### Here the writer gives more details on the topic
- they flow from general to more specific.
- For example, Topic: Reflective writing on how you used technology in your lessons/lectures
- Technology plays a very big role in the life of a successful student. 
- It is highly unlikely that technology will not offer a solution to a university student’s problem, 
- whether it is related to the subject they are studying,
- working on assignments, student union, researching, reading materials or academic support.
- Since I started my degree course at ARUL, 
- I have also relied on technology for various matters, 
- and I feel very positive about the benefit of using technology in studies. 


> #### **As you see above, the writer has moved from general in the beginning to more specific towards the end.**
---
## Thesis statement and outline
- A thesis statement **states the main idea** of the whole writing.
- A thesis statement in an essay is like the topic sentence of a paragraph.
- A thesis statement also uses appropriate **signposting language** such as, 
  - The main ideas discussed in this work are…
  - This work will describe, evaluate and analyse…
- The thesis statement may also indicate the **pattern of organisation** of the essay. 
- This outline can be written as a separate sentence, or embedded within the thesis statement.
- For example, **This essay will first look at the literature relevant to the strategy, then present the problems in implementing this strategy and finally suggest possible solutions to them**. 
---
## Example thesis statement
> #### Topic: Reflective writing on how you used technology in your lectures
- Technology plays a very big role in the life of a successful student.
-  It is highly unlikely that technology will not offer a solution to a university student’s problem, whether it is related to the subject they are studying, working on assignments,student union, researching, reading materials or academic support.Since I started my degree course at ARUL, I have also relied on technology for various matters, and I feel very positive about the benefit of using technology in my studies. 
- This work presents a reflective commentary on the role of technology in my studies. 
- After describing the topic and commenting on my feelings and thoughts on it, I will evaluate and analyse the experience I have had so far in relation to the topic.
- In the latter part, I will present my conclusions of my reflections and possible action plan for future improvement.

(Note: In the possible answer, theoutline has been embedded within the thesis statement)

## Homework – Writing (from week 1)

>### Your writing [homework from week 1](/csweek1moduleintroduction/materials/IndependentstudyWeek1Writingactivity.md) was to write a short reflection on an event / situation / experience you had (which you shared with your friends in groups last week). 
---
## Assignment topics
>### Here are the three topics for your CS1 assignment; you will write a reflective paper on ONE of the topics.

1. Materials and activities used in your lessons/lectures
2. ARUL campus facilities and amenities
3. Involvement and participation in your lessons/lectures

>### Your writing homework for this week is to write the Introduction to your reflective paper. 

## A special note on your writing HW

> #### Each week from weeks 2 – 8, you will get writing HWs which are directly linked to your assignment, so writing HW is very important.
- #### If you decide to write your final reflective assignment on the topic you have chosen in week 1 or 2, you may combine all your writing HWs together which may make your final submission. Of course, you may need to add/delete and amend aspects in your work before submitting it.
- #### But if you want to write your final paper on a different topic, you are free to do so too, but you will need to write it from scratch – it is entirely up to you!
