## Introduction breakdown: 
#### Opening sentence
Teaching, as many will agree, is a service rather than a profession, or at least it used to be.
#### background details(general)
Teaching is not one of the best-paid jobs in most countries, neither is it in my country, therefore, it may be said that many individuals, if not all, who get into teaching profession may be driven by other factors, not necessarily by pay or promotion opportunities or holidays. 
#### Background (more specific)
The first practical teaching experience that many of the new teachers get in my country is the teaching placement, which is a part of the teacher training course, and upon successful completion of this placement, a trainee teacher becomes a licensed or registered teacher. I completed my teaching placement a few months ago. 
#### Thesis statement 
This piece of reflective work explains, evaluates, and analyses an event in the first few weeks of my teaching placement followed by a presentation of the lessons I have learned from it and how I will execute those lessons in real terms in the future. 
## Description breakdown:
### when/where did it happen
I am currently on a teaching practice placement in an adult education college in the south-west of England, learning how to teach GCSE maths to various groups of adults. As my placement is in the early stages, I am mainly assisting the class lecturers and have just started planning and delivering a small part of each lesson.
### what happened 
The incident I am reflecting on in this paper occurred in an evening class in which I was due to deliver my very first teaching session. The class lecturer had been teaching the learners about fractions, one of the commonly used mathematical topics, and 
### why were you there
my task was to continue with the same topic, looking specifically at how to multiply two fractions. 
### what happened 
However, when I was due to teach the session and got to the whiteboard, I became so nervous that I struggled to speak to the group. I felt myself visibly shaking and was unable to articulate even my first sentence coherently.
### who was present
The students
### What did you/ other people do
were quite understanding, as they were all mature people who were aware that I was new to teaching and that I was nervous, but the teacher was unsympathetic and responded by taking over the lesson instantly. She did not even say a thing to me but started teaching the class as if nothing had happened there. 
### Outcome of the situation
Very perplexed and upset, I went to the back of the classroom and sat at one of the desks trying not to cry. I left the session as soon as the class was over and did not speak to anyone there that day.
