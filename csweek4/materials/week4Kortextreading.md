> You and your thoughts and experiences are the starting points for reflective writing. 

## Something happens ...
- A group of first year Product Design students meet for the first time to work in a large team ...
>This is chaos.
We’ll never
get it done ...

>She hasn’t said
anything yet.

>We need to
make a decision
... we’re running
out of time ...

- This is, of course, mind reading – an impossibility! Any written
- account of an experi- ence comes after, 
- and will be edited in some way. 
- That said, the sooner you make
- notes or write down your experiences, 
- the better you will remember not only your
- feelings at the time but what actually happened.
- Feelings are so strong! And we all tend to focus on the negatives ...
- Unconfident ... impatient ... annoyed ... resentful ... rejected
- Rather than trying not to think about the experience (which many people do with an
- experience they’d prefer to forget!), these students have to concentrate on it and analyse their reactions.




## What happened?
On the next page are some of the written comments the students made soon after the short group project was completed, in response to the question:

> #### What was the most challenging aspect of the project for you personally?
>found it was
difficult to get a
message across ...

>... the language barrier
... the others might not
understand what I
was saying ... I felt a
bit brushed off ...

>Working with new
classmates ... we didn’t
know each other and
didn’t know what each
one was good at ...

>... a group of people
formed the core of the
group and dominated
decision making ... I
had to fight my way ...

>... trying to take a leading
role without looking like a
control freak ...


>... I come from another
language and culture ... So there
was an invisible gap amongst
all of us ...

>... I know that a quiet
person can have an
idea or opinion which is
just as good as those of
an outspoken one ...

>... trying to take an important
role ... it was all too easy to let
others get on with it ...


>A few moments of reflection leads to analysis and a more balanced view of the situation.

## Reflecting on how you learn
In the comments below, you can see how each writer analyses their experience of
learning, and shows self-knowledge in their reflection:
- ‘I have been a last-minute person since school years and it has extended into
university years. I feel more motivated when I am doing my work at the very last
minute.’ (Education student)
- ‘I found the exercises required me to think in ways I wouldn’t necessarily do
naturally.’ (Medical student)
- ‘My brain is splitting with trying to learn so much in such a short space. Working in
the hotel is so different from what I imagined.’ (Business and Hospitality student)
- ‘I love the rush of idea generation, sketch development and the tension of the
process.’ (Creative Arts student)

- These kinds of comments may form part of a reflective journal, in which the writer looks back at past experiences to inform their future development:

>When I was at school, there was not a strong emphasis on learning another language. 
- English was/is seen as the key language to the world ... I feel a lot of my resistance to learning another language has been influenced by this attitude ...
and attending lessons was a chore I didn’t want to do ...
- As an adult, I can see how many of the lessons were uninspiring and I had no
reason to believe that learning would be to my advantage ...
- As a teacher I hope to be able to ...
- Advanced Methodology of Foreign Language Teaching, undergraduate
- You can see how the writer’s reflections move through time:
from the past: When I was ... I didn’t want to ... I felt ....
to the present: I can see now ... I find that ...
to the future: I hope to be able to ... I’d like to ...
- Chapter 6 takes a closer look at the language to use in reflective writing.
