## Activity 1 
### Example Feelings/thoughts paragraph
> ##### Read the example Feelings/thoughts paragraph in the box below. Then work in pairs or small groups and discuss the following questions.



- I was quite happy when I learnt that the assignment was going to have a teamwork component,
- and I very much looked forward to working with the others on the team. 
- I even thought that we were smart when we divided the task among us even before we had met.
- But then we came together and realised that some of the team members had not actually done their job, and I almost lost hope in the team. 
- The concerns then were that there was still a lot of work to do, 
that some team members needed extra support and the deadline was approaching, 
- and that we were all different individuals with varied tastes and issues.
- Consequently, I felt very stressful during that part of the assignment.
- Because I had hoped that the teamwork was going to be the best part of the assignment, 
- but it turned out to be the opposite,
- I got frustrated too. However, when I realised that two team members had to cancel their plans for unexpected health and family related reasons, 
- I ended up feeling very guilty, 
which stimulated me to work harder in the next couple of days to get the work done. 
- To my and the team’s complete joy, we gave in our work on time. 
  
  
  > #### Looking back, I’m feeling extremely satisfied that we decided to put in the work.

Example text (Bailey, 2011):

When Andy Warhol died at the age of 58 in 1987, few people guessed that  
he would soon become one of the most valuable artists in the world. In 2007, total sales of his work at auction reached $428 million. When, a year later,  his  painting 'Eight Elvises' sold for over $100 million, It  was one of the highest prices ever paid for a work of art. 
In his working life, he made about 10,000 artworks, and dealers believe that  it will continue to be popular with collectors in the future. This is because of Warhol's huge reputation as a super-cool trendsetter and innovator. He will also be remembered for his remark: 'In the future everyone will be famous for 15 minutes', which seems to forecast today's celebrity culture.
