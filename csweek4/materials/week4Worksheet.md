## Activity 1 
### Example Feelings/thoughts paragraph
> ##### Read the example Feelings/thoughts paragraph in the box below. Then work in pairs or small groups and discuss the following questions.

- I was quite happy when I learnt that the assignment was going to have a teamwork component,
- and I very much looked forward to working with the others on the team. 
- I even thought that we were smart when we divided the task among us even before we had met.
- But then we came together and realised that some of the team members had not actually done their job, and I almost lost hope in the team. 
- The concerns then were that there was still a lot of work to do, 
that some team members needed extra support and the deadline was approaching, 
- and that we were all different individuals with varied tastes and issues.
- Consequently, I felt very stressful during that part of the assignment.
- Because I had hoped that the teamwork was going to be the best part of the assignment, 
- but it turned out to be the opposite,
- I got frustrated too. However, when I realised that two team members had to cancel their plans for unexpected health and family related reasons, 
- I ended up feeling very guilty, 
which stimulated me to work harder in the next couple of days to get the work done. 
- To my and the team’s complete joy, we gave in our work on time. 
  
  
  > #### Looking back, I’m feeling extremely satisfied that we decided to put in the work.
