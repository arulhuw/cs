# 7 A reflective diary or learning journal
# 1
>Students across a range of disciplines are often asked to keep a reflective diary,
portfolio or journal. This is not really surprising since a diary/log/journal is a record of
your development as a learner or practitioner in your field. Exactly what goes in your
journal will, of course, vary from one discipline to another.


## Learning journals in creative and technical subjects
>Students learning to create or build something – for example a bridge (Engineering), a
product (Product Design), a structure (Architecture) or an artwork (Creative Arts) – will
be learning to:

- **look at** or observe objects, paintings, structures
- **analyse** what they see (form, function, materials)
- **consider** how each element contributes to the whole
- **be aware** of how they have borrowed, changed or built on the ideas of other
practitioners, artists or theories
- **reflect** on their own developmental process: starting, experimenting, changing,adapting, starting again.

- This development of ideas is likely to be recorded in a personal **record** or**sketchbook** or lab diary. 
    - Often it is only later that you can see the origins of the ideas you work on.
    - You don’t see it at the time, 
    - which, of course, under- lines the importance of these informal records, 
    - not only for students in these disciplines but for everyone who wants or needs to chart their development. 
    - Only at the end of the process do you see the path to the outcome clearly.


> You can then write a summative piece that explains and justifies the choices you made
along the way:

- The starting point for this work came from a trip to **Africa**.
  - **Brief context**
- **I noticed** a variety of objects washed up on the beach, old jeans, shoes and sacks and I tried to imagine who they might have belonged to ...
  - **Imagining and reflecting**
  - **Observing and reflecting**

- I looked at Marcel Duchamp, Christian Boltanski and Bill Woodrow to see how artists made use of found **objects**
  - **Building on other artists’work**
- I **noticed** that when two or three unrelated objects were placed together [...] the audience would find themselves trying to identify a link between the objects 
  - **Observing and reflecting**
  - **Awareness of audience and reflecting**
- I looked at ways of preserving the objects and learnt about casting and the range of materials to cast from including **wax**, chocolate, resin and plaster 
  - **Experimenting**
- I wasn’t really happy with how the wax teacup **turned out** I became fascinated with **shoes** 
  - **Testing feelings and reflecting**
  - **changing**
- I discovered **fibreglass** – the delicacy and opaqueness of the fibreglass shoes 
  - **Experimenting reflecting**
- I hope the installation stimulates the memories
and imagination of the **audience**. 
  - **Connecting with audience**

## Design, construct, test ... to destruction
>Technical courses at college or university – Engineering, Computing, Architecture – add a bit of spice to the process outlined above. At some point in the course, students are likely to



- work in design teams: Does better teamwork lead to better designs?
- sketch or model the design: How does it help the design process?
- build it within the constraints of materials, cost and time
- test it to destruction: How resilient is the structure? How well designed?


>Finally, looking back and reflecting on the whole process, what have you learnt?

|The brief: build a bridge<br> Working in groups you are required to design and later construct a  bridge as specified below ... Only the following materials may be used ... The following costs apply ... <br>Thanks to Nick Spencer Chapman, Chartered Engineer, Lecturer, Construction Management|

## Time to reflect on ...
|Keep it simple stupid (KISS) – one person talked like he knew what he was doing but it was far too complicated to build in time and our semi-finished bridge didn’t even support itself.|
|-----------|
- Group processes
- Design process
- Construction and
- destruction
|We should have organised the construction better. We rushed and half the team didn’t know what to do. The team next door even had cutting lists and everybody had jobs – they didn’t rush and finished early.|
