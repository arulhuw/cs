## Activity 1 - 

>##### Example description

- The event I am reflecting on for the assignment purposes is my first day at my current job. 
Although I had been looking forward to this job very much, and had made my plans relating to travel, lunch and what I was going to wear, I still felt quite nervous in the morning. 

- To begin the day, I got up much earlier than usual, partly due to the excitement and partly because of the long distance to work, and then I spent considerable time getting ready trying to present myself in the most acceptable and elegant style as possible – it was my first day at my new job! Travelling to work was smooth with buses and trains on time and fast enough.

- Consequently, arriving at work half an hour earlier than expected, I was met with my line manager Mr. Carpenter who introduced me to the receptionists and the rest of the staff that I was going to work with. Then, I spent most of the remaining part of the day with Mr. 
  - Carpenter filling out forms, listening to his induction talks, watching some first-day videos and going through a number of policies and procedures. 

- I am not a great fan of induction talks, especially if they all come from a single individual, however, induction talks can be mostly useful for the future. However, my lunch, surprisingly provided by the company as it was my first day, was with four other staff from the same department as mine who had been working there for varied periods, from 2 to 9 years. I was also glad that I was allowed to take two 15-minute breaks – one in the morning and the other in the afternoon.  

- Finally, my first day here, despite not being hugely eventful, but a productive and stress-free one, came to an end at 5 o’clock.

    1. Does the paragraph effectively and fully describe the writer’s first day at work? 
    2. Is the paragraph clear, readable and logically structured? How?
    3. Identify the techniques the writer has used to make the paragraph coherent (means linked together, readable, and easy to follow)? Find examples for each of these techniques.
    4. Would you expect to see the writer express their feelings and thoughts, evaluate and analyse in this paragraph? Why/not?
    5. If you were asked to write this paragraph again, how could you do it better?

## Activity 2. 
 1. Why is it difficult to understand the topic of the text? What would help right at the start? 
 2. Couldn't understand
 3. What is the problem with the use of pronouns such as you, your, she etc.? Why might it cause confusion?
 4. The writer uses many words with similar meanings: flaws, limitations, problems, obstacles, barriers, constraints. Why might this be distracting for the reader?
 5. Does the writer sometimes repeat words/phrases? Where do you notice that? Do you think this has a positive or negative effect on the reader?
 6. Why is it sometimes difficult to see the connection between some of the sentences that are right next to each other?


## Extract A
- It might seem instinctive to hide any flaws – limitations with your research to protect himself from criticism. 
- A student needs to highlight any problems she encountered during the investigation phase, any restrictions with your approach.
    • Markers are expecting pupils to engage with obstacles. Draw attention to the kind of impact barriers may have had on their examination. 
    • Be careful that you do not overemphasise the constraints. Overemphasising the constraints could undermine the reliability and validity of their consequences. Overemphasising the constraints could undermine the character as an experimenter.

## Activity 3. 
>##### Why is the above text not coherent/cohesive? 
- too many synonyms  
- pronouns                                 
- repetition
- no title                           
- inconsistent                                           
- bullet form
- Linking                                              
- relationships
  -  Extract A is not cohesive because it is hard to tell what it is about. It has _________and the sentences are not connected (some are in _________).

  - The use of _________ (e.g., she, your, himself, you, their, etc. is wrong or _________ (keeps changing from one sentence to another), and this creates more problems with cohesion.

  - There are also _________  that throw the reader off balance (e.g. flaws, limitations, problems, restrictions, obstacles, barriers, constraints) and sometimes they do not relate to the topic.

  - In other places, there is unnecessary _________ (e.g. overemphasise the constraints is repeated three times!)

  - Finally, there are no ________ words/phrases to help us understand the ________
 between sentences (e.g., contrast, cause-effect, example, etc.)

## Activity 4. 
- The non-coherent Extract A in Activity 3 has been re-written as follows. 
>##### Ignoring limitations
>It might seem instinctive to hide any flaws or limitations with your research to protect yourself from criticism. However, you need to highlight any problems you encountered during the research phase, or any limitations with your approach. This is because your markers are expecting you to engage with these limitations and highlight the kind of impact they may have had on your research. Nevertheless, just be careful that you do not overstress these limitations as doing so could undermine the reliability and validity of your results, and your credibility as a researcher.
