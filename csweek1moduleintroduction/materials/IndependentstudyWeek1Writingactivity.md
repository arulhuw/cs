Answer box:


During my first week at ARU I had to contact the attendance team due to being marked absent.
On the 22nd may I arrived at 9.30 am. before the lecture started. 
Even though I clicked the in class Attendance before 10:30 am it was marked absent on my attendance.

I was abel to use the form on the VLE to contact the, Attendance team They confirmed my enquiry by email. After a couple of days I received another email confirming the mistake has been corrected.

The user experience around navigating the website straight forward and simple. although the mobile version i.e android phones doesn't display(download) the up to date attendance sheet.
