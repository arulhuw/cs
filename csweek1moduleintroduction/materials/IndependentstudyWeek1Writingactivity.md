Answer box:


During my first week at ARU I had to contact the attendance team due to being marked absent.

On the 22nd may I arrived at 9.30 am before the lecture started and  used  the in class Attendance button before 10:30 am to confirm my presence.

I was abel to use the form on the VLE to contact the  Attendance team, They confirmed my enquiry by email. After a couple of days I received another email confirming the mistake has been corrected.

The user experience around navigating the website straight straight forward and simple. Although the mobile version i.e  doesn't display(download) the up to date attendance sheet.
