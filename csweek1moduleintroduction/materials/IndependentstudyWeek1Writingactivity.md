During my second week at ARU I had to contact the attendance team due to being marked absent on the attendance report. On the 22nd may I arrived at 9.30 am before the lecture started. 
Using the in class Attendance button on the VLE I proceeded to  confirm my presence. 

Eventhough the system acknowledge the form submission  it did't show up on my attendance report. 


After confirming with updated attendance report
 
 contacting  the attendance team.

Navigating to the Attendance Enquiry Form from the VLE was straight forward. After completing the form I received  an email confirming the enquiry.
