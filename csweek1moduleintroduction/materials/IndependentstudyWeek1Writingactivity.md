Answer box:


During my first week at ARU I had to contact the attendance team due to being marked absent.

On the 22nd may I arrived at 9.30 am before the lecture started. 
Using the in class Attendance button before 10:30 am I was able to confirm my presence.

After completing a form  to contact the Attendance team  I received a confirmation email. Within the same week  I received another email confirming the mistake has been corrected.
